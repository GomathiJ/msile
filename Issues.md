# About Issues #

In the future this page will contain information about how to submit issues.

Currently the code and wiki are in such an early stage that you probably won't bother, but if you do, go to the [issue submission page](http://code.google.com/p/msile/issues/entry). You can really post about any issue, be it the code or the wiki, or something else related to the project.
