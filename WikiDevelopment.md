# Wiki Development #

This page describes the development process of the wiki, and what you can do to help.




---


## Wiki Guidelines and Conventions ##

The [Wiki Guidelines](WikiGuidelines.md) page has detailed information about which guidelines and conventions are followed in the creation of the wiki.

## Translating ##

You can support the project by translating the wiki pages to your language. To do so, check the [Wiki Translating](WikiTranslating.md) page.

## Writing Your Own Wiki Pages ##

I feel it is highly unlikely that you could possibly want to contribute something as documentation, but you may actually want to contribute something! Be it a guide, or some information you think users could use, whatever, just [get in touch](Contact.md)! You can simply write something and send it to me, and I'll take care of formatting it for you.

Do note however that the content (but not necessarily its formatting) must follow the [Wiki Guidelines](WikiGuidelines.md). It may be edited to comply.

## Correcting Mistakes ##

Have you found a mistake with the wiki?

Please submit it as an [Issue](Issues.md). Issues are relevant to everything covered by the project, including the wiki content.

You can also simply [Contact](Contact.md) a project member with a patch.
