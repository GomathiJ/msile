# Roadmap #

The following gives a rough outline of what may happen in the upcoming releases.

## General Ideas ##

### <font size='2'>Short term</font> ###

In the short term, I expect to write code to do most of the basic functionality, especially the UI.

### <font size='2'>Long term</font> ###

In the long term, I plan to develop two other tools besides the msile client: the msile Administrator (which will help create and mantain repositories), and the msile Packager (which will help create `.msi` packages from regular installations).

## Version-specific ##

### <font size='2'>0.1 Alpha up to 0.4 Alpha</font> ###

Don't expect anything here. The code will probably be refactored, development will be likely only done by me and so the code will be very terse and unfriendly to anyone else.

### <font size='2'>0.5 Beta up to 0.9 Beta</font> ###

0.5 Beta will be the first beta version, and as so, will be more open to developers besides myself. Also, it will be in a certain sense alpha quality, because some things are expected to be missing (I'll want to push something useful soon even if there are rough edges).

### <font size='2'>1.0 Stable up to before 2.0</font> ###

From version 1.0 the software will be considered "stable", which again will be kind of beta quality. You can expect an unpolished outline in the beginning, but it should have most of the intended features in an usable state.
