== Name ==

The name of the project is `msile`.

=== <font size="2">Etymology</font> ===

It is a portmanteau that blends "`msi`" (the file extension for Microsoft Installer packages) with "missile".

=== <font size="2">Pronunciation</font> ===

It is pronounced "missile".

=== <font size="2">Casing</font> ===

It is lowercase, as in "msile" (does not begin with a capital letter).

This is because:

  # `.msi` is a file extension; file extensions are most commonly lowercase.
  # If it was "MSIle", it would be a source of confusion because `I` and `l` are too similar.
  # If it was "MSILE", it would look like the code is in `BASIC`, `FORTRAN`, `COBOL`, or even worse, `C++`.
  # It goes against the norm, which is good for branding.
  # I like the way it looks.
  # _Language purists can go â€œlook for the unmatched double-quotes._

=== <font size="2">Will it change?</font> ===

Probably the logo will, at some point. The icon will stay.

=== <font size="2">Will a missile represent the application?</font> ===

Yes.

Of course the application will not look like a missile nor anything, but yes, it will use missiles (with the same look and colors) in other places.
