This page describes how to build the code documentation.

I have built [http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndoc3/ NDoc3] binaries (which besides from the repository you may also grab them [http://www.mediafire.com/?g1l4wncookb6clc here]), and I'm investigating their use.

Why not use Sandcastle you ask? I've outlined some reasons in [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10053013 this question].

The idea is to use XSLT transforms to generate wiki pages here.

I'm looking at that right now.
