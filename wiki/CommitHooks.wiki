This project may use commit hooks to aid in development. Any commit hook used will be explained here; you do not have to use these hooks, but you'll have to do what they do manually.

If you do not know how to add a commit hook, refer to TortoiseSVN documentation.

== `update-assembly-revision.bat` ==

This is a pre-commit hook.

What this does is to check for whatever `AssemblyInfo.cs` file below your current directory, and update its revision number to *the current revision number + 1*.

If you do not want to run it, before commiting code in the trunk or a branch, update the relevant AssemblyInfo.cs file to use *the current SVN revision number + 1* as the *third assembly and file version*.

=== <font size="2">Example</font> ===

This code in the `AssemblyInfo.cs` file:

<code language="cs">
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("0.1.123")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("0.1.123")]</code>


Will become this:

<code language="cs">
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("0.1.124")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("0.1.124")]</code>

(This example assumes the current revision number at the time of commit is 123).
