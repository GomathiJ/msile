Please don't try this out just yet, it's simply not ready, when something's more showcaseable I may even provide downloads anyway.

But if you want to know how I compile, I simply use Visual Studio. I'm pretty sure you can use MSBuild or other tools, but you should be just fine by grabbing a free copy of Visual Studio and hitting `F6`.

Oh and the whole thing is set to compile for x86 because that's what I have.
