= About =

When this project reaches a stable maturity (which will be version `1.0`), it will be a GUI package manager (similar to Linux ones, such as Aptitude or Synaptic) for Windows, based on MSI files (hence the name).

The target audience will be mostly !SysAdmins wishing to create _their own repositories_ (and use them) easily. Therfore, it will focus on making the job easier for them.

In the future, there will be tools for creating your own repository and mantaining it with ease, and tools to re-package existing Windows application instalations as silent MSI files.
