# Branding #

This page deals with the branding of the project.

## Name ##

The name of the project is `msile`.

### <font size='2'>Etymology</font> ###

It is a portmanteau that blends "`msi`" (the file extension for Microsoft Installer packages) with "missile".

### <font size='2'>Pronunciation</font> ###

It is pronounced "missile".

### <font size='2'>Casing</font> ###

It is lowercase, as in "msile" (does not begin with a capital letter).

This is because:

  1. `.msi` is a file extension; file extensions are most commonly lowercase.
  1. If it was "MSIle", it would be a source of confusion because `I` and `l` are too similar.
  1. If it was "MSILE", it would look like the code is in `BASIC`, `FORTRAN`, `COBOL`, or even worse, `C++`.
  1. It goes against the norm, which is good for branding.
  1. I like the way it looks.
  1. _Language purists can go â€œlook for the unmatched double-quotes._

<h3><font size='2'>Will it change?</font></h3>

Probably the logo will, at some point. The icon will stay.<br>

<h3><font size='2'>Will a missile represent the application?</font></h3>

Yes.<br>
<br>
Of course the application will not look like a missile nor anything, but yes, it will use missiles (with the same look and colors) in other places.<br>
