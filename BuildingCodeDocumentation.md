## <font size='2'>NDoc3</font> ##

I have built [NDoc3](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndoc3/) binaries (which besides from the repository you may also grab them [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?g1l4wncookb6clc)), and I'm investigating their use.

Why not use Sandcastle you ask? I've outlined some reasons in [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10053013).

The idea is to use XSLT transforms to generate wiki pages here.

I'm looking at that right now.
