# Developers #

This page will contain information for developers.

Since the project is in its infancy, I suppose there's nothing you can do at the moment. Development is being carried out by me, [Camilo Martin](http://about.me/camilomartin), and I'm still working things out.

Nevertheless, I'll feature some things that might be of developer interest here.
